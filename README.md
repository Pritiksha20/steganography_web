# Steganography Web Project

The **Steganography Web Project** is a web-based application that allows users to hide secret messages within digital images using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique. This project ensures secure communication by embedding data in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye, without altering the quality of the image.

## Features
- **Encode Messages**: Hide secret messages within an image.
- **Decode Messages**: Extract hidden messages from an encoded image.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface.
- **Secure Communication**: Messages are securely embedded and extracted using LSB steganography.

## How It Works
Steganography works by modifying the least significant bits of the pixel values in an image to store secret data. These changes are so minor that they are invisible to the human eye, making the image appear unchanged.

### Encoding Process
1. The user uploads an image and enters a secret message.
2. The message is converted into binary format.
3. The binary message is embedded into the least significant bits of the image's pixel values.
4. The encoded image is saved and can be downloaded.

### Decoding Process
1. The user uploads an encoded image.
2. The least significant bits of the image's pixel values are extracted.
3. The binary data is converted back into the original message.
4. The decoded message is displayed to the user.
